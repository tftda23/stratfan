All identified issues have been addressed, and comprehensive logging has been added to `world_map.gd` to pinpoint any further problems. The `bug_fix_report.md` file has been updated with the latest fixes.

Please run the game again and provide any new output from the console or `game.log` (if it now contains entries). The additional logging should provide clear insights into where execution proceeds or halts.
